# CollaRE Cutter Plugin

This plugin allows importing and exporting project edited project data (function names and comments).

## Installation

Place the `CollaRe.py` file into the plugin folder for Cutter (usually `<USER_HOME>/.local/share/rizin/cutter/plugins/python/` for Linux and `a` for Windows). The options to import and export data will then be located at the bottom of the `File` menu.

## Usage

Run the script from `File > CollaRE Import/Export`. Make sure to always do Import before you export something to avoid data loss! Please note that this plugin requires a CollaRE project to be open.
